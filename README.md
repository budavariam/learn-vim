# Learn vim

This repository contains materials that helped me get comforatble with vim.

I collected shortcuts and commands into [my cheatsheet](./vim-cheatsheet.md).
I used a simplistic tone, to help me get familiar the basics in a practicable manner.

Once you dive into vim you'll realize there are much more combinations.
My goal was just to give an overview of the features, shortcuts, and commands that can boost productivity.

I figured that the best way to learn vim is to practice it.
Only reading these helpful lines is not very effective, it does not go into muscle memory, so I wrote a simple [python3 code](./practice.py) to practice my tips.

## My main/recommended sources

* `vimtutor` command, it is basically a textfile opened with vim that gives you a solid base
* [openvim](https://www.openvim.com/), a nice interactive tutorial
* [vim.rtorr](https://vim.rtorr.com/), a great cheatsheet that inspired me to create my own collection
* [vim fandom](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki), a wiki page with useful tips and tricks
* vim help

For fun I try to solve challenges from [vimgolf](https://www.vimgolf.com/)

## My Configuration

My vim configuration (`.vimrc` file) is available in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/budavariam/dotfiles).
